    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      New York strip steak is a tender cut with a marvelous fatty edge and deep,
      beefy flavor. For perfect results, sear it in a cast-iron skillet and
      finish it in the oven. You'll get a gorgeous crusty exterior and a juicy
      interior, just like in a steakhouse.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>NY Strip Steaks</li>
      <li>butter</li>
      <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 500°F. Heat a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over
        high heat until smoking hot. Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of the steak
        with kosher salt and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the steak in the hot skillet. Cook, without moving, for 2 minutes
        on each side, creating a nice crust. Then, cook the fat strip for 30
        more seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using oven mitts, transfer the skillet to the hot oven. Roast the steak
        to medium rare, 3-4 minutes. For medium, roast for 4-5 minutes. Place
        the steak on a plate and loosely cover it with foil. Allow it to rest
        for 5 minutes, then top it with butter and serve.
